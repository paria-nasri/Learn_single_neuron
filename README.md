The Simplest Math Problem
Using a tensorflow app to figure relationship between x & y and discover the rules .

keras frame work in tensorflow is used - definig a sequence of layesrs (in this code there is only one layer with the type of Dense.

loss function is mean squared error and optimizer function is Stochastic gradient descent (sgd)

fit the xs to the ys and do the loop 500 time (500 epochs)
